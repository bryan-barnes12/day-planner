    This project challenged me to build a day planner that stores events in local storage that are available until removed manually.

<br>
 This project was difficult in that it required me to stick to the scope of the requirements and not spend a lot of time building functionality that wasn't required. While I'm pretty pleased with how it turned out, I can't help but feel like I'm failing in regard to user interface.
